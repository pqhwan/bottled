Steps for installation

1. "git clone" this repository (do not open it on Xcode yet!)
2. Download and install Cocoapods (http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) 
    ! MAKE SURE YOU DOWNLOAD THE PRE-RELEASE VERSION (command: "gem install cocoapods --pre")!
3. Go to your local repository, make sure you have a file called "Podfile," and call the command "pod install"
4. "pod install" takes a while. As the command's output will tell you at the end, you must open the .xcworkspace file that will be created in your repository (instead of .xcodeproj).
